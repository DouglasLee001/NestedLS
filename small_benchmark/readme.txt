this classic benchmark consists of 2 dataset.
the instances containing no less than 250 vertices are 'big', while others are 'small'
The results reported in paper are 'big' instances.

the 1st dataset contains 2 types of instances:
1st_classic_dataset_connected_Type1_big
1st_classic_dataset_connected_Type1_small

2st_classic_dataset_connected_Type2_big
2st_classic_dataset_connected_Type2_small

some of instances in the 1st dataset are not connected, they are listed in:
1st_classic_dataset_not_connected

the small and big instances of 2nd dataset are:
2nd_classic_dataset_small
2nd_classic_dataset_big
